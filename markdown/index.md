## Description

In this course we will be discussing the theoretical design and the
practical implementation of functional programming languages.  These
type of languages allow us to study programming language features from
a wide range of programming languages in a simplified setting.  We
will also be learning the advanced proof system called
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

## Course Goals

The goals of this course consist of global goals and specialized
goals.  The former is a set of goals that I believe will benefit the
student in a wider area of life than this course, while the
specialized goals are the goals of understanding programming language
theory.

### Global Goals

The global goals seek to help the student with broad knowledge that
will help them throughout life.  For example, in other courses and in
their future -- or current -- jobs.  It could be argued that all of
this course fits this perspective, but not every student will become
programming language researchers or implementors.  

The global goals can be summarized as goals that aim to train the
student in critical thinking, and mathematical and logical reasoning.
Specifically, we will attempt to understand the following concepts:

- Mathematical proof, especially, proof by induction,
- Logic,
- Recursive thinking,
- Reading advanced computer science material,
- Basics of formalized mathematics and verification, and
- the basics of programming language design and implementation.

The global goals are the main goals I really want everyone to take
away from the class.

### Specialized Goals

Specialized goals amount to the content of the course.  This can be
found in the [Course Schedule](/lectures.html ).    

## Graded Work

A perfect score is $200$ total points:

- (25\%) 7 10-point graded homework assignments.

- (25\%) 16 weekly video lecture quizzes; each lecture.

- (25\%) A take-home midterm exam: 02/22. 

- (25\%) A take-home final exam: 05/03. 

No scores will be curved throughout the semester.  Please use the
following scoring tables:

- Undergraduates:

  + A : $80\% - 100\%$
  + B : $70\% - 79\%$
  + C : $60\% - 69\%$
  + D : $50\% - 59\%$
  + F : $00\% - 49\%$

- Graduates:

  + A : $88\% - 100\%$
  + B : $78\% - 87\%$
  + C : $68\% - 77\%$
  + D : $58\% - 67\%$
  + F : $0\% - 57\%$

## Course Communication

This course has a slack channel.  Please joint it here: [Slack Registration](https://join.slack.com/t/augustaspace/shared_invite/zt-kqtl6qfk-rjR976X_VjRj8w3nT7dX_w ) 

All course discussion and annoucements will take place on Slack.  The only time Slack should not be used is when discussing grades.  I will not respond to questions via email unless they are grade specific.

Slack Rules:

- No inapprorpiate messages will be tolerated.
- You must add your fullname (First and Last) to your profile.
- All course annoucements will be shared in [\#annoucements](https://plauworkspace.slack.com/archives/C01H91REG3H).
- Course discussion will take place in the channel [\#office_hours](https://plauworkspace.slack.com/archives/C01HPQAKSQJ).
- For fun I've created [#random](https://plauworkspace.slack.com/archives/C01HQ0YGLBV) for sharing all the gifs and memes.

## Attendance

Attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.  

## Getting Help

Professors like students have many duites and commitments, and so to
be better prepared to help the students outside of class I have the
following office rules that must be adhered to:

- If a student needs help, and the question is small -- takes at
  most five minutes to answer -- then the student may visit my
  office at any time, but
- if the question takes longer than five minutes, then the
  student is required to make an appointment by slack, or attend
  office hours.

If a student comes to my office unannounced and the question takes
longer than five minutes, then that student will be instructed to make
an appointment or to come back during office hours.

Appointments are to be scheduled via slack and must contain the
following:

- The students name,
- a brief description of what the problem is, and
- a time the student would like to meet.

Collaboration is important in all areas of study.  So I recommend
talking to other students for help.  However, there is a rule that
must be followed: **while discussing homework solutions in a group of
two or more no one is allowed to write anything down, and each student
must prepare their solution in isolation**.

## AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY POLICIES

The Augusta University faculty and administration believe that, for
students to be prepared for career success, it is important for them
not only to know the subject matter in their majors, but also to
demonstrate professional, ethical, and responsible business and social
behavior.  Whether a person is interviewing for a job, participating
in a business or academic social event, or attending class, there are
some important characteristics of personal behavior that are expected
by colleagues and administrators.  In the business work environment,
employees can be dismissed for behavior that is distracting or
disruptive to other employees, customers, or administrators.

### Class Attendance

If the student has been absent for more than the equivalent of 10
percent of class time, regardless of cause, then the professor may
withdraw the student from the class for excessive absences. It is
important to note that the instructor may—or may not—withdraw a
student from class based upon attendance. In any case, a student
should not assume that the instructor has initiated the withdrawal
form. A student not withdrawn from a course who stops attending class
(or who never attends class) is subject to receiving a grade of WF or
F for the course. Please reference the Class Attendance section of the
Augusta University Student Manual for further details.

Each student is expected to attend class regularly, to arrive on time,
and to remain until class is dismissed. Tardiness and leaving class
early are disruptive for other students and the faculty and are
behaviors that are not acceptable in a classroom or business setting.
Students who do not arrive promptly or leave early may be noted as
absent, at the faculty member’s discretion.  Absences in excess of the
maximum prescribed in the course syllabus may result in the faculty
member’s withdrawing the student from the course.

### Code of Conduct

Please review the Student Code of Conduct in the Augusta University Student
Manual. It outlines your responsibilities as students and those of a
faculty member to maintain the integrity of the learning
environment. As outlined in the handbook, disorderly or distracting
conduct may result in expulsion from the class. Moreover, any form of
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Should you be caught
cheating or plagiarizing the work of another the procedures as
outlined in the handbook and catalog will be followed.

The classroom should be considered a place of business - academic
business. Distracting behavior such as uninvited casual talk among
students, use of cell phones and beepers, sleeping, or inappropriate
behavior toward fellow students or faculty will not be tolerated any
more than they would be in a business setting. Faculty have the right
and the responsibility to maintain a classroom free of such
distractions. Students who persist in such behavior may be asked to
leave the class and may be counted absent for the session. Persistent
disruptive behavior may result in the faculty member’s withdrawing the
student from the course.

### Disabilities

Students with disabilities must contact the Office of Testing and
Disability Services (706-737-1469) before the start of the
semester. If you require special accommodation, the office will send a
classroom accommodation form to affected faculty. Should you require
special accommodations, please contact me at the beginning of the
semester to determine how they will be implemented. Please reference
the Testing and Disability Services section of the Augusta University
Student Manual for further details. 

### Academic Dishonesty

In an academic community, honesty and integrity must prevail if the
work done and the honors awarded are to receive their respect. The
erosion of honesty is the academic community’s ultimate loss. The
responsibility for the practice and preservation of honesty must be
equally assumed by all of its members. Any type of dishonesty in
securing those credentials therefore invites serious sanctions, up to
and including, a WF in the course, and expulsion from the institution.
Examples of dishonesty include actual or attempted cheating,
plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false information to any
university employee. Please reference the Academic Honesty section of
the Augusta University Student Manual for further details and specific definitions of
cheating and plagiarism.

Unethical behavior of students in any form is not acceptable and will
not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty (see definitions in the
following sections) - cheating on exams, plagiarism of the work of
others, unapproved collaboration on graded work, and the like - will
be dealt with immediately and with clear consequences. Depending on
the nature and severity of the problem, a student who is guilty of any
such violation may be: 1) withdrawn from the course with a grade of WF
(counted as an F in the GPA); 2) given a grade of zero on the
assignment; 3) given a grade of F in the course; or 4) otherwise
penalized, at the discretion of the faculty member. Two occurrences of
a WF grade for academic dishonesty will result in a student’s being
expelled from the University, per current University policy as
described in the University Catalog.

### Student Appeals and Grievances

Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly
under these guidelines should first address the matter with the
faculty member responsible for the class.  If the problem is not
resolved, the student may meet with the Dean or follow procedures
outlined in the Academic Grievance Policy section of the Augusta University Student
Manual.

carry” legislation, effective as of July 1, 2017 --

### ACADEMIC DISHONESTY DEFINITIONS

Any attempt to present intentionally the work or knowledge of others
as your own on a graded test or assignment constitutes academic
dishonesty.  The following illustrations do not include every possible
variation of academic dishonesty, but they are examples of the kinds
of infractions that will be considered academic dishonesty violations.
If you have questions about academic dishonesty, please ask any
faculty member or any administrator in the School of Computer and
Cyber Sciences.  It is your responsibility to recognize and avoid
initiating or contributing to academically dishonest behavior.

### CHEATING ON A TEST, EXAM, OR ASSIGNMENT

- **Closed-book, closed-notes tests.** The use of any
  materials except those provided by the faculty member or provided
  for in test instructions is considered cheating.  The use of
  prepared notes, electronic aids, assistance from others, or the use
  of any information obtained from others (with or without their
  permission) during the test is considered cheating.

- **Open-book, open-notes tests**. Assistance from others
  or the use of any information obtained from others (with or without
  their permission) during the test, without the permission of the
  instructor, is considered cheating.

- **Independent projects or papers**. If the faculty member’s
  instructions require independent, unassisted work on a project or
  paper, no portion of the assignment may be prepared by anyone else.
  Having any part of the assignment prepared by someone else, or in
  collaboration with someone else, is considered cheating unless the
  instructor’s instructions specifically call for such collaboration.

- **Assisting others with test information**. Because many courses are
  taught at multiple times, it is important that students in one
  section of a course not provide information about a test to any
  student in another section who will take the same or a similar test
  at a later time.  To do so will be considered cheating.

### PLAGIARISM

- **Failure to give credit to others**. On individual and group
  assignments – projects, papers, presentations, research studies, and
  the like – no portion of the work may contain quotations of or
  paraphrasing (rewording) of the work of others unless each such
  reference is clearly identified with an appropriate footnote or
  bibliographical reference to the original source and author.  To not
  give credit to others in each such instance is to present the work
  of others as if you had written it yourself.  That is considered
  plagiarism.  Style manuals (such as the American Psychological
  Association manual) provide guidelines for footnoting, quotations,
  and other means of giving credit for the work of others.  Your
  instructor may prefer some particular style.  If no guidelines are
  provided, it is your responsibility to use a standard style or ask
  the faculty member for guidance.

- **Ghost writing**. It should go without saying that having someone
  else write some or all of a paper or do a project for which you are
  individually responsible constitutes academic dishonesty.  Whether
  the author is a friend, a paid writer, or a person who offers such
  services on a web site, the result is an intention to present
  someone else’s work as your own and will be treated as an academic
  dishonesty infraction.
